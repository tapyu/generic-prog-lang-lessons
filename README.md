- **Arrays**: A collection of elements identified by index or key, its size is fixed once it is created, that is, you cannot delete, create, or change the order of an element array. However, you can change the element value.
- **Linked Lists**: A collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. You can delete, create, or change the order of a linked list element. If it is a *doubly linked list*, each node contains a pointer to the next and the previous node,
  - **Stacks**: Special dace of linked list which works in Last In First Out (LIFO) manner.
  - **Queues**: Special dace of linked list which works in First In First Out (FIFO) manner.
- **Trees**:
  - **Binary Trees**: Trees where each node has at most two children.
  - **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child is less than the parent, and the right child is greater.
  - **AVL Trees**: A self-balancing binary search tree.
  - **Heap**: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
- **Hash Tables**: A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.
- **Graphs**:
  - **Directed Graphs (Digraphs)**: Graphs with directed edges.
  - **Undirected Graphs**: Graphs with undirected edges.
  - **Weighted Graphs**: Graphs with weighted edges.
  - **Graph Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List**: Different representations of graphs.
- **Trie**: A tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array.
- **Hash Map**: A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type using a hash function to map keys to indices.
- **Sets**: A collection of distinct elements.
- **Queues (Priority Queue)**: A type of data structure that stores elements in a way that each element has a priority assigned to it.
- **Deques (Double-ended Queues)**: An ordered set of elements in which elements can be inserted or removed from either end.
- **Skip List**: A data structure that allows fast search within an ordered sequence of elements.
- **Union-Find (Disjoint Set)**: A data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
