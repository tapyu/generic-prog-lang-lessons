# Testing

### Different Types of Tests
- **Unit Tests**: Unit tests are the easiest tests to write because you can expect specific results for your input. There are no dependencies or complex interactions.
- **Integration** Tests: Integration tests are more complex than unit tests because you have to deal with dependencies.
- **End-To-End Tests**: End-to-end tests simulate a specific user interaction flow with your app. For example, clicking or entering text.
